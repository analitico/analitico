# Serverless Alexa Skill Example

This example demonstrates how to setup your own Alexa skill using AWS Lambdas.

## Use-cases

- Building custom Alexa skills

## How it works

In the Alexa Developer Portal you can add your own skill. To do so you need to define the available intents and then connect them to a AWS Lambda. The Lambda you can define and update with Serverless.

## Setup

In order to deploy the endpoint simply run

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading service .zip file to S3 (2 KB)...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
Serverless: Stack update finished...

Next we need to setup a Alexa skill. Once you've signed up for the Amazon Developer Platform visit `https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html`. There you should see the following screen:

Go through the steps and fill in all the required fields e.g. Intent Schema and Sample Utterances:

Intent Schema
```
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "GetLuckyNumbers",
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "UpperLimit",
          "type": "AMAZON.NUMBER"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Sample Utterances
```
GetLuckyNumbers what are my lucky numbers
GetLuckyNumbers tell me my lucky numbers
GetLuckyNumbers what are my lucky numbers lower than {UpperLimit}
GetLuckyNumbers tell me my lucky numbers lower than {UpperLimit}
```
